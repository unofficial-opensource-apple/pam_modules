.Sh DESCRIPTION
The authentication for remote installation of Mac OS X Server module for PAM,
.Nm ,
provides simple root authentication for the remote installation and setup of Mac OS X Server.  It does so by authenticating the root user with a password matching the first eight characters of the authenticating computer's serial number.
.Pp
The module will only authenticate if the filesystem root,
.Dq / ,
is mounted as read-only.
.Pp
If the serial number can not be read, for whatever reason, authenticating with the password "12345678" will be allowed instead.
.Pp
This authentication modules is intended to only be used with Mac OS X Server installation and setup.  Any other usage may be a security risk and is not recommended.
